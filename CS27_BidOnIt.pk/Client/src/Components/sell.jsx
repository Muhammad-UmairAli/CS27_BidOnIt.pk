                Benefit for seller by seeling online as compare to Market
              </p>
              <p>
              the most common question we get from sellers is what benefit they will get from selling items on our website than in the market? The answer is pretty simple, our website enables you to sell your products while staying home 
              so you do not have to get into the hussle of going to place to place to try and sell your products. We also deal in slightly used itms, if you want to sell your used products you can get the right price through our website. 
              we allow you to set the price for biding and all the conditions are according to your choice once we approve the product. while going out to the market and selling your products may seem appealing but it comes with a lot of work. 
              by using our website you will be able to work from the comfort of your home. once you have posted a product you do not need to worry at all the auction will keep going and once your product is sold you will get instant payments.
              this reduces a lot of your work.

                How BidOnit will give your advantage?
              </p>
              <p>
                BidOnIt is not any regular auction online website. Its special ecommerce based auction wesbite 
                where a seller can sell its product in his desired time and can get all price. The wesbite will pay seller 
                other amount which is left.The price he sets as market price, our system will start acution from 30% of the market price and timer starts.

              </p>
              <p>
                BiOnIt also keeps track of scam and spam users also so they can not put bids on products untill we verify them. 
                Sellers do not need to take tension for this. Seller can sell product by staying at home and in quick time and best price.
